# Online Resume


### Project Recap

This project serves as an online version of my resume. This is NOT my portfolio, but just a scale replica of my resume along
with other added information. Essentially, all of my experiences and tech stack is included in this website. This is something
that I created a long time ago, before I even had a portfolio. This website is fully responsive and can be viewed across multiple
different devices.
